    description: "The original Hyundai Kona was a subcompact crossover SUV that helped establish Hyundai in the rapidly growing small SUV segment. Featuring distinctive styling with a split headlight design, contrasting roof color options, and aggressive body cladding, it stood out in a crowded market. Built on a platform shared with the i20/i30, it was available with various powertrain options depending on the market, typically including 1.0L and 1.6L turbocharged gasoline engines, and in some regions, diesel options. Front-wheel drive was standard with all-wheel drive available on higher trims. The interior offered modern technology including an available 8-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and a range of active safety features under the SmartSense banner. A performance-oriented N Line variant was added later in the generation, featuring a more powerful engine and sportier styling. A significant facelift in 2020 updated the styling with an even more distinctive front end and enhanced technology. Electric and hybrid variants were also offered (as separate models). This generation established the Kona as one of Hyundai's global best-sellers, appealing to buyers with its combination of distinctive styling, technology, and value."

    description: "The current Kona features a complete redesign with a more futuristic appearance inspired by the brand's 'Parametric Dynamics' design language. Significantly larger than its predecessor in nearly all dimensions, it offers improved passenger and cargo space. The exterior maintains the split headlight design but with a more refined execution, featuring a full-width LED light bar and pixelated details that echo Hyundai's IONIQ electric vehicles. Powertrain options vary by market but typically include a 2.0L naturally aspirated four-cylinder, a 1.6L turbocharged four-cylinder, and hybrid variants. For the first time, Hyundai developed the electric version first and adapted it for internal combustion engines, rather than the reverse. The interior represents a major advancement with a dual 12.3-inch panoramic display combining digital instruments and infotainment under a single piece of glass, ambient lighting, and improved materials. Technology has expanded to include advanced driver assistance systems, over-the-air updates, and digital key functionality. The sporty N Line continues as the performance-oriented option with unique styling elements and a more powerful engine. This generation elevates the Kona's position with more upscale features and design while maintaining its distinctive character in an increasingly homogenized segment."
